          <p>
          Hello World! Iâ€™m Kevin Iza a Software Developer based in Brooklyn, New York. I have experience in Front-end development as well as application development. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My interest in coding began when I witnessed firsthand the shift from flip and sliding phones to smartphones. Looking back the rate at which the market changed and adopted new technology inspired me to want to create and participate in this new wave of technology.
